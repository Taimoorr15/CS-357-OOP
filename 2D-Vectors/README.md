# 2D-Vectors
This is the class for 2D Vectors
A 2D vector is a quantity that has both magnitude (length) and direction in a two-dimensional plane. It can be represented as an ordered pair (x, y), where x and y are the vector's components along the horizontal (x-axis) and vertical (y-axis) directions, respectively
