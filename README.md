# Inheritance
Inheritance allows one class (child/derived) to inherit the properties and methods of another class (parent/base). It helps in code reuse, reduces duplication, and maintains a logical hierarchy. Think of a Father class having money and skills. The Son class can inherit these, without redefining them. But the son can also have his own features too.
