📚 CS-357: Object-Oriented Programming & Software Engineering A comprehensive collection of OOP projects, assignments, and implementations developed during the CS-357 course.

📖 About This Repository

This repository serves as a centralized hub for all my Object-Oriented Programming coursework and projects. It contains implementations of core OOP concepts, design patterns, and real-world applications built using industry-standard practices.

🎯 Learning Objectives

Master the four pillars of OOP: Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, and Polymorphism
Implement common design patterns (Singleton, Factory, Observer, etc.)
Develop clean, maintainable, and scalable code
Apply SOLID principles in software design
Build real-world applications using OOP paradigms

Birthday Paradox
The birthday paradox is the counter-intuitively high probability that at least two people in a group share the same birthday. The "paradox" is that a group of only 23 people has a greater than 50% chance of a shared birthday. This happens because the number of possible pairs of people increases with the size of the group, and the probability of any pair matching is what's being calculated, not a specific date

Driver Management System
The Driver Management System is a mini Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) project built in Python. It models real-world entities like Person, Driver, License, and Car using OOP concepts such as inheritance, composition, and association Driver Management System which keeps track of all the drivers and their authenticity.

Cashier Change
This programm shows us how the cashier works when giving us change. P-1.31 Write a Python program that can “make change.” Your program should take two numbers as input, one that is a monetary amount charged and the other that is a monetary amount given. It should then return the number of each kind of bill and coin to give back as change for the difference between the amount given and the amount charged. The values assigned to the bills and coins can be based on the monetary system of any current or former government. Try to design your program so that it returns as few bills and coins as possible
