Learn about Association, Aggregation and Compositionn to link classes where inheritance is not applied
## OOP Relationships

### Association  
A general **"has-a"** relationship between two classes where both can exist independently.  
It simply indicates that one class uses or knows about the other.

### Aggregation  
A special type of association representing a **whole–part relationship**.  
The whole contains parts, but the parts can still exist even if the whole is destroyed.

### Composition  
A strong form of aggregation where the **whole owns the parts**,  
and the parts cannot exist independently if the whole is destroyed.
